                    <p>I started elementary a year earlier than the average kid.
                      I went to Immanuel Mission International School from first
                      grade up until fourth grade. My sister graduated so I
                      decided to transfer schools as well. For fifth grade I took
                      an exam for City Central School. I passed, but sadly my
                      name wasn't anywhere to be seen in the list of students
                      for the sections so I was enrolled in a regular section.
                      It was only found out that I was accidentally enrolled
                      to a higher grade (sixth grade), and it was in the middle
                      of the school year too. I just decided to continue. For my
                      sixth grade me and my parents decided that I should
                      transfer, and so I found myself learning a lot in COC.
                      Basically COC was the source of my knowledge for passing my
                      High School choice exam.

                    <p>For Junior High School (at this time this term still did
                      not exist yet), I took an exam for Gusa Regional Science
                      High School-X. When the results were out, only my mom went
                      out to check them. I was pretty anxious about the results
                      because I wasn't able to review AT ALL. But my mom was more
                      anxious between us two. I remember her arriving home and
                      telling me that she was scanning through the results paper
                      starting from top 20+ up and did not find my name. She
                      repeated it until she decided to check from the first
                      paper, and apparently I was 15th! It might be the only
                      thing I'll ever be proud of in my whole life, I thought.
                      So four years passed and I survived the hell that was
                      GRSHS-X, but it was fun going through it with the same
                      section (there were no shuffling). There were lots of
                      activities as well, both academic and non-academic!

                    <p>For Senior High School, a lot of us were set on staying in
                      GRSHS-X, me included. Somehow it was the best option for us
                      that time. And of course I did not regret it. Hard the
                      training might be, it produced us to be more than qualified
                      for college at least(?). We were shuffled, at first we
                      expected it not to end well but apparently the sections we
                      had were all gucci! The new curriculum was a bit chaotic
                      since we were the first ones to experience SHS. Our batch
                      unanimously think we did not learn a lot because of this, sadly.

                    <p>For college I took exams and passed them. I was having
                      second thoughts of where to enroll. I was thinking of UPD
                      but I thought of many lazy things and I was too scared to
                      adjust to new things lol. My options were USTP and MSU-IIT
                      then. I enrolled for MSU-IIT already. Computer Science.
                      During vacation though I took a lot of time thinking of
                      things that might actually happen during college. And so
                      for the last minute (it was nearly June or so), I told my
                      mom what if I withdrew my enrolment in IIT and go for USTP
                      instead. She was delighted and immediately went with me to
                      do the deed. At last I'm here in USTP. I hope I won't be
                      regretting it. Sometimes I think of what-ifs...
